# StrataScratch Solution: Monthly Percentage Difference
**Company**: Hard Difficulty | **ID**: 10319  
**Skills**: Window Functions, LAG, Date Formatting, CTEs, Time Series Analysis  
**Interview Context**: Business Intelligence, Financial Analytics, Growth Metrics  

## Problem Statement
Given a table of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.

**Formula**: Percentage change = ((this_month_revenue - last_month_revenue) / last_month_revenue) * 100

## Business Context
**Why this matters in enterprise scenarios:**
- **Revenue Growth Tracking**: Understanding business momentum and seasonal patterns
- **Financial Reporting**: Monthly KPIs for executive dashboards and board presentations
- **Performance Analysis**: Identifying growth trends and potential business issues early
- **Budget Planning**: Forecasting and variance analysis for financial planning
- **Business Intelligence**: Core metric for SaaS, retail, and subscription business models

## Solution Approach

**Step 1**: Aggregate revenue by month using proper date formatting  
**Step 2**: Use LAG window function to get previous month's revenue  
**Step 3**: Calculate percentage difference with proper NULL handling  
**Step 4**: Apply rounding and sorting requirements  

## ðŸŽ¯ Oracle-Optimized Solution

### âœ… PRIMARY SOLUTION (First Attempt Success)
```sql
-- Oracle Database solution using CTEs and LAG window function
-- âœ… VALIDATED: Works on first execution
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    -- Step 1: Aggregate revenue by month
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
        SUM(value) AS monthly_revenue
    FROM sf_transactions
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM')
),
monthly_comparison AS (
    -- Step 2: Add previous month revenue using LAG window function
    SELECT 
        year_month,
        monthly_revenue,
        LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year_month) AS prev_month_revenue
    FROM monthly_revenue
)
-- Step 3: Calculate percentage difference
SELECT 
    year_month,
    CASE 
        WHEN prev_month_revenue IS NULL THEN NULL  -- No percentage for first month
        WHEN prev_month_revenue = 0 THEN NULL      -- Avoid division by zero
        ELSE ROUND(
            ((monthly_revenue - prev_month_revenue) / prev_month_revenue) * 100, 
            2
        )
    END AS percentage_change
FROM monthly_comparison
ORDER BY year_month;
```

**Why this approach excels:**
- **Single table scan** with efficient GROUP BY aggregation
- **LAG window function** handles time series analysis elegantly  
- **Proper NULL handling** for edge cases (first month, zero revenue)
- **Oracle-optimized** date formatting with TO_CHAR
- **Clean CTE structure** for readability and maintainability

### Alternative Solution (Enhanced Date Handling)
```sql
-- Alternative with explicit date handling for edge cases
WITH monthly_revenue_alt AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) AS year_val,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) AS month_val,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) || '-' || 
        LPAD(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at), 2, '0') AS year_month,
        SUM(value) AS monthly_revenue
    FROM sf_transactions
    GROUP BY 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at),
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at)
),
monthly_comparison_alt AS (
    SELECT 
        year_month,
        monthly_revenue,
        LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (
            ORDER BY year_val, month_val
        ) AS prev_month_revenue
    FROM monthly_revenue_alt
)
SELECT 
    year_month,
    ROUND(
        ((monthly_revenue - prev_month_revenue) / 
         NULLIF(prev_month_revenue, 0)) * 100, 
        2
    ) AS percentage_change
FROM monthly_comparison_alt
WHERE prev_month_revenue IS NOT NULL  -- Exclude first month
ORDER BY year_month;
```

## Expected Business Output
```
year_month | percentage_change
-----------|------------------
2019-01    | NULL             (first month)
2019-02    | 15.50           (15.5% growth)
2019-03    | -8.75           (8.75% decline)
2019-04    | 25.33           (25.33% recovery)
2019-05    | 2.45            (2.45% steady growth)
```

## Business Impact Analysis

**Oracle DBA Performance Perspective:**
- **Index Strategy**: Composite index on (created_at, value) for optimal aggregation
- **Partitioning**: Month-based partitioning ideal for this query pattern
- **Statistics**: Date column histograms critical for accurate execution plans
- **Execution Plan**: Hash aggregation followed by window sort operation

**Enterprise Scalability:**
- **120+ TB datasets**: Pattern scales with parallel query execution
- **Real-time analytics**: Suitable for materialized views with incremental refresh
- **Financial reporting**: Core pattern for monthly business reviews
- **Performance monitoring**: Sub-second execution achievable with proper indexing

## Key Learning Points

### Technical Skills Demonstrated:
1. **Window Functions**: LAG for time series analysis with proper ordering
2. **Date Manipulation**: TO_CHAR vs EXTRACT approaches in Oracle
3. **NULL Handling**: Multiple strategies (CASE WHEN, NULLIF, WHERE clauses)
4. **CTEs**: Clean, readable multi-step logic organization
5. **Business Logic**: Percentage calculations with proper rounding

### Financial Analytics Applications:
- **Revenue Trend Analysis**: Month-over-month growth tracking
- **Seasonal Pattern Detection**: Identifying cyclical business patterns
- **Executive Reporting**: KPI dashboards and financial summaries
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual growth/decline pattern identification
- **Forecasting Input**: Historical trend data for predictive models

## Production Considerations (Enterprise Scale)

**Performance Optimization:**
```sql
-- Production version with hints and monitoring
SELECT /*+ PARALLEL(sf_transactions, 4) FIRST_ROWS(100) */
    year_month,
    ROUND(((monthly_revenue - prev_month_revenue) / prev_month_revenue) * 100, 2) 
        AS percentage_change
FROM (
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
        SUM(value) AS monthly_revenue,
        LAG(SUM(value)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM')) AS prev_month_revenue
    FROM sf_transactions
    WHERE created_at IS NOT NULL  -- Filter NULLs early
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM')
)
WHERE prev_month_revenue IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY year_month;
```

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
```sql
-- Add execution monitoring for production
SELECT 
    sql_id,
    child_number,
    plan_hash_value,
    executions,
    elapsed_time/1000000 as elapsed_sec,
    buffer_gets,
    disk_reads
FROM v$sql 
WHERE sql_text LIKE '%monthly_percentage%'
  AND parsing_schema_name = 'ANALYTICS_USER';
```

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) where n = number of transactions (GROUP BY + sort)
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) where m = number of distinct months
- **Oracle Execution**: Hash aggregation + window sort, highly optimized for time series

## Enterprise Applications (Financial Services Context)

**Similar Use Cases**
- **Subscriber Growth Analysis**: Month-over-month customer acquisition
- **Revenue per User**: ARPU trend analysis across billing cycles
- **Network Usage Patterns**: Data consumption growth tracking

**Real-World Extensions:**
```sql
-- Extended for multiple product lines
SELECT 
    product_category,
    year_month,
    ROUND(((monthly_revenue - LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (
        PARTITION BY product_category 
        ORDER BY year_month
    )) / LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (
        PARTITION BY product_category 
        ORDER BY year_month
    )) * 100, 2) AS percentage_change
FROM monthly_product_revenue
ORDER BY product_category, year_month;
```
